            <div class="query-box">
                <h5>Query 1: What are common indicators of phishing emails?</h5>
                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Common indicators include urgency, poor spelling/grammar, suspicious URLs, generic greetings, requests for personal info, suspicious attachments, and too-good-to-be-true offers.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 9.95s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.39</p>
                <div class="response-box">As a cybersecurity expert specializing in phishing detection, I can tell you that common indicators of phishing emails include:

1. Urgency to take action: Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency, trying to prompt the recipient into taking some sort of action (e.g., "Your account will be closed if you don't update your password within the next hour").
2. Suspicious links or attachments: Phishing emails may contain links that seem legitimate but actually lead to malicious websites or attachments that can download malware.
3. Poor grammar and spelling: Legitimate companies usually have a professional tone in their communications, so poor grammar and spelling may indicate a phishing attempt.
4. Unfamiliar sender: If you don't recognize the sender's name or email address, it could be a red flag.
5. Generic greetings: Phishing emails often use generic greetings like "Dear user" instead of addressing you by your actual name.
6. Overly formal language: Scammers may try to sound overly formal or official in their emails, which can raise suspicions.
7. Threats or warnings: Phishing emails might claim that your account has been compromised or that you need to take immediate action to avoid consequences.

It's essential to be cautious and verify the authenticity of an email before taking any action. If you're unsure about a particular email, it's always best to err on the side of caution and report it as suspicious.</div>

            <div class="query-box">
                <h5>Query 2: How can organizations prevent phishing attacks?</h5>
                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Prevention techniques include education, email authentication, anti-phishing tools, multi-factor authentication, security software, email filtering, limited social media sharing, and regular security assessments.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 11.87s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.21</p>
                <div class="response-box">As a cybersecurity expert specializing in phishing detection, I'd like to emphasize that preventing phishing attacks requires a multi-layered approach. Here are some effective ways organizations can protect themselves:

1. **Employee Education**: Train employees on how to identify and avoid phishing emails, phone calls, and texts. This includes being aware of common tactics, such as urgency, misspellings, and generic greetings.
2. **Security Awareness Programs**: Implement security awareness programs that simulate phishing attacks and provide feedback to employees on their responses.
3. **Email Filtering**: Use email filtering tools that can detect and block suspicious emails, including those with malicious attachments or URLs.
4. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Require two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users to ensure that even if a password is compromised, the attacker won't be able to gain access without the 2FA token.
5. **Phishing Detection Tools**: Utilize phishing detection tools that can analyze emails, URLs, and attachments in real-time to detect potential threats.
6. **Regular Software Updates**: Ensure all software, including operating systems, browsers, and plugins, are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
7. **Network Segmentation**: Segment your network to limit the spread of malware in case of a successful attack.
8. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor user behavior and system logs for suspicious activity.
9. **Incident Response Planning**: Develop an incident response plan that outlines procedures for responding to and containing phishing attacks.
10. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems**: Implement SIEM systems that collect, monitor, and analyze security-related data from various sources to detect potential threats.

By implementing these measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing attacks.</div>

            <div class="query-box">
                <h5>Query 3: What was the Google Docs phishing attack?</h5>
                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> A 2017 attack where victims received emails appearing from contacts sharing Google Docs. When authorized, a third-party app harvested contacts and forwarded to others, affecting about one million Gmail users.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 4.06s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.54</p>
                <div class="response-box">The Google Docs phishing attack, also known as the "Google Docs Worm," was a sophisticated email-based phishing attack that sent victims an email claiming someone they knew had shared a Google Doc. When users clicked the link and authorized what appeared to be Google Docs, they actually gave access to a third-party app named "Google Docs" which then harvested their contacts and forwarded the phishing email to everyone in their address book. This attack affected approximately one million Gmail users before Google shut it down within an hour.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="query-box">
                <h5>Query 4: What is spear phishing and how does it differ from regular phishing?</h5>
                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations, unlike regular phishing which casts a wide net with generic messages to many potential victims.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 6.40s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.57</p>
                <div class="response-box">Spear phishing is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or organizations, often based on prior knowledge of the victim's identity or characteristics. This differs from regular phishing attacks, which typically use broad, unsolicited emails to catch unsuspecting victims.

In spear phishing, attackers usually conduct thorough research on their target, gathering information about their interests, job title, company, or other identifying factors. This helps them craft a more convincing and personalized message that appears to come from someone the victim trusts. The goal is often to trick the individual into divulging sensitive information or performing an action that benefits the attacker.

Spear phishing attacks are often more sophisticated and targeted than regular phishing attempts, making them more difficult to detect and respond to. They can be particularly effective because they tap into the human tendency to trust familiar names and faces, making it easier for attackers to manipulate victims into taking the bait.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="query-box">
                <h5>Query 5: What techniques do phishers use to create urgency?</h5>
                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Phishers create urgency by using threatening language, imposing artificial deadlines, claiming security incidents, and using authoritative impersonation to force quick actions without verification.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 7.99s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.36</p>
                <div class="response-box">Based on the context, specifically the Real-world phishing example: The Gmail/Google Docs Worm (2017), I can identify some common techniques used by phishers to create a sense of urgency:

1. **Time-sensitivity**: Phishers might claim that the victim needs to take immediate action, such as updating their account information or verifying their identity, within a specific time frame.
2. **Limited-time offers**: Attackers might pretend to offer exclusive deals, promotions, or limited-time opportunities to create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out).
3. **Sense of responsibility**: Phishers may try to make the victim feel responsible for taking action quickly, such as by claiming that their account has been compromised or that there's an issue with their personal information.
4. **Fear-mongering**: Attackers might exploit fear or anxiety by creating a sense of urgency around sensitive topics like security breaches, identity theft, or financial losses.

These tactics aim to create a false sense of urgency, encouraging victims to act quickly without fully thinking through the situation, which can increase the likelihood of them falling prey to the phishing attack.</div>

                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> A 2017 attack where victims received emails appearing from contacts sharing Google Docs. When authorized, a third-party app harvested contacts and forwarded to others, affecting about one million Gmail users.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 3.83s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.54</p>
                <div class="response-box"> The Google Docs phishing attack was an instance of Email Phishing, specifically a sophisticated form known as Spear Phishing, where the attacker impersonated someone known to the victim and targeted Gmail users. The attack used social engineering techniques to trick victims into authorizing a third-party app named "Google Docs," which actually harvested their contacts and spread the phishing email further. This particular example affected approximately one million Gmail users before Google managed to shut it down within an hour.</div>

                <h5>Query 4: What is spear phishing and how does it differ from regular phishing?</h5>
                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations, unlike regular phishing which casts a wide net with generic messages to many potential victims.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 6.29s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.48</p>
                <div class="response-box"> Spear phishing is a targeted type of phishing attack in which the attacker seeks to trick a specific individual or organization by crafting an email that appears as if it comes from someone they know or trust, containing information personalized to that recipient. This makes the email more convincing and harder for the intended victim to recognize it as fraudulent.

This differs from regular phishing in terms of its level of specificity and personalization. While general phishing emails are sent out en masse to a large number of people, spear phishing is directed at a select few individuals with a higher degree of detail and information relevant to the victim's interests or role within an organization.

Examples of spear phishing include impersonating a coworker, a friend, or even a family member to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information or clicking on a malicious link that could compromise their system or steal data.</div>

                <h5>Query 5: What techniques do phishers use to create urgency?</h5>
                <p><strong>Ground Truth:</strong> Phishers create urgency by using threatening language, imposing artificial deadlines, claiming security incidents, and using authoritative impersonation to force quick actions without verification.</p>
                <p><strong>Response Time:</strong> 9.42s | <strong>Relevance Score:</strong> 0.45</p>
                <div class="response-box"> Phishers often create a sense of urgency by using tactics such as:

1. Time-Sensitive Threats: They may claim that the recipient's account will be suspended, their credit card information revoked, or some other negative consequence if they don't act immediately.

2. Scarcity and Exclusivity: Phishers might send messages claiming to offer exclusive deals, discounts, or prizes that are only available for a limited time or to a select few, encouraging the recipient to click on the link without thinking carefully about the potential risks.

3. False Sense of Urgency in Responding to Requests: Phishing emails might claim that they need immediate assistance with an issue, such as asking for help in resolving a problem with the recipient's account.

4. Fear and Panic: Some phishing messages aim to instill fear or panic in the recipient, making them more likely to act impulsively and disregard potential warning signs. This could involve claiming that there is a security issue with the recipient's account or that legal action will be taken if they do not comply promptly.

5. Social Proof: Phishers might use social proof techniques, such as impersonating well-known organizations or people, to make their messages seem more legitimate and trustworthy, increasing the sense of urgency to act quickly.</div>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>This experiment was conducted using the following methodology:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Created a dataset of phishing-related information</li>
            <li>Split documents into chunks of 500 tokens with 50 token overlap</li>
            <li>Created embeddings using each model</li>
            <li>Built RAG systems using each model for both embeddings and generation</li>
            <li>Tested each system with the same set of cybersecurity queries</li>
            <li>Measured response time, relevance (compared to ground truth), and response length</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Based on the results, we can observe which models perform best for cybersecurity RAG applications in terms of speed, relevance, and verbosity. This information can help security teams select the most appropriate model for their specific needs, balancing performance and resource requirements.</p>
